The original code provided is listed as pymaceuticals_starter(original), while all of the work for the assignment is saved in pymaceuticals_starter(working). The analysis below is saved in that file as well as listed below for line of sight.

After analyzing the data provided, we can draw a few conclusions about the study results. The mice in the study were approximately evenly distributed between genders. Although more mice in the study were treated with Capomulin and Ramicane, the difference between those mice and the mice taking other treatments was not significant enough to skew the data.

When reviewing the final tumor volume averages by drug, it is apparent that Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective at reducing tumor size over the study period. There were some mice who experienced significant tumor reduction with the drug Infubinol, but they were outliers when compared to the rest of that drug's data. After reviwing a single Capomulin mouse's tumor reduction across the study period, we can see that the final tumor volume was over 13% less than the start of the trial.

Additional conclusions can be reached regarding the relationship between mouse weight and tumor size. The linear regression model and Pearon's correlation coefficient both show a strong positive correlation between weight and tumor size. This leads us to believe that the more a mouse weighs, the more likely it is to have a larger tumor.

It is important to note that more analysis could be done to this data to support additional conclusions. For example, we did not review the effects of age or the number of metastatic sites in relation to each drug's effectiveness. Although the analyses below point to seemingly clear results, review of additonal possible factors could skew or support those findings.
